# Queues, infix expression & radix sort, review for Exam 1

## Queues
* First in, first out data structure. Modeled after a 'queue' or a line of people waiting.
    * Remove the first data element. Last in last out.
    
    ### Accessor Methods
    
    1. front() - constant time
    
    ### Mutator Methods
    1. dequeue() - return front item
    2. enqueue() - adds to the back of the queue
    
    
## Infix evaluation

``` python
eval('2 + 2 + 5 * 6')
```
tokens - individual strings representing operators or operands
split() ['2', '+', '2', '+', '5', '*', '6']

* Create two stacks for operators and operands


## Radix Sort

['bba', 'cd', 'a', 'aa']
* Uses a queue

Have a main Queue (has fron and back), and some list of other queues associated with the different characters. Have to look at whitespace characters. Google how to do radix sort.
